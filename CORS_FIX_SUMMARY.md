# CORS Configuration Fix - Summary

## Problem Identified

The original CORS configuration had critical security issues:

```python
# BEFORE (Insecure)
cors_origins = ["*"]           # Allows ANY website
cors_allow_credentials = True  # Allows cookies/auth headers
```

### Why This Was a Problem

1. **Violates CORS Specification**: The combination of `allow_origins=["*"]` with `allow_credentials=True` violates the browser CORS specification. Browsers will **REJECT** these requests.

2. **Security Risk**: Even if it worked, allowing `["*"]` means any malicious website (e.g., evil.com) could make authenticated API requests on behalf of logged-in users, potentially:
   - Stealing sensitive data
   - Modifying or deleting resources
   - Performing actions without user consent

3. **Unnecessary for Current Architecture**: TeckoChecker serves the Web UI and API from the **same origin**:
   - Web UI: `http://localhost:8000/web` (or `https://tt.keboola.ai/web`)
   - API: `http://localhost:8000/api` (or `https://tt.keboola.ai/api`)
   - Same-origin requests bypass CORS entirely - no CORS configuration needed!

## Solution Implemented

### Changes Made

1. **app/config.py** - Updated default CORS settings:
   ```python
   # AFTER (Secure)
   cors_origins: list[str] = Field(
       default=[],  # Empty list = CORS disabled
       description="Allowed CORS origins (empty list disables CORS)",
   )
   cors_allow_credentials: bool = Field(
       default=False,  # Credentials disabled by default
       description="Allow credentials in CORS requests"
   )
   cors_allow_methods: list[str] = Field(
       default=["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE"],  # Specific methods only
       description="Allowed HTTP methods for CORS",
   )
   cors_allow_headers: list[str] = Field(
       default=["Content-Type", "Authorization"],  # Specific headers only
       description="Allowed headers for CORS",
   )
   ```

2. **app/main.py** - Added comprehensive documentation:
   - Explained when CORS is needed vs. not needed
   - Documented security considerations
   - Explained what CORS protects against
   - Provided examples for future configuration

3. **.env and .env.example** - Updated with secure defaults:
   ```bash
   CORS_ORIGINS=[]
   CORS_ALLOW_CREDENTIALS=false
   CORS_ALLOW_METHODS=["GET","POST","PUT","DELETE"]
   CORS_ALLOW_HEADERS=["Content-Type","Authorization"]
   ```

## Security Benefits

### Before Fix
- ❌ Any website could attempt to call the API
- ❌ Combination violates CORS spec (browsers reject)
- ❌ Potential security vulnerability if ever deployed with different origins
- ❌ Overly permissive configuration

### After Fix
- ✅ CORS disabled by default (secure for same-origin setup)
- ✅ Only same-origin requests allowed
- ✅ External websites CANNOT make requests to the API
- ✅ Complies with CORS specification
- ✅ Principle of least privilege - specific methods/headers only

## Understanding CORS

### What is CORS?
CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a browser security feature that controls which websites can make requests to your API from JavaScript.

### When is CORS Needed?
CORS is ONLY needed when the Web UI is served from a **DIFFERENT domain** than the API:
- Example: UI at `https://ui.example.com` calling API at `https://api.example.com`

### When is CORS NOT Needed? (TeckoChecker's Case)
CORS is NOT needed when Web UI and API are on the **SAME origin**:
- TeckoChecker: Both at `http://localhost:8000` (or `https://tt.keboola.ai`)
- Same-origin requests bypass CORS automatically
- No configuration needed!

### What Does CORS Protect Against?
Without CORS restrictions, a malicious website could:
1. User visits malicious website (evil.com)
2. Malicious JavaScript makes requests to your API
3. If user is logged in, requests include their session/cookies
4. Attacker can steal data or perform actions as the user

CORS ensures only trusted origins can make cross-origin requests.

## Future Configuration

If you need to allow external tools or different origins:

1. **Add Specific Origins** (recommended):
   ```bash
   CORS_ORIGINS=["https://external-tool.example.com","https://other-tool.com"]
   ```

2. **Enable Credentials** (only if needed):
   ```bash
   CORS_ALLOW_CREDENTIALS=true
   ```
   ⚠️ **NEVER** use with `["*"]` - browsers will reject!

3. **Adjust Methods/Headers** (if needed):
   ```bash
   CORS_ALLOW_METHODS=["GET","POST","PUT","DELETE","PATCH"]
   CORS_ALLOW_HEADERS=["Content-Type","Authorization","X-Custom-Header"]
   ```

## Testing the Fix

Run the verification script:
```bash
python verify_cors_fix.py
```

Expected output:
```
✓ CORS is disabled (secure default for same-origin setup)
✓ Credentials are disabled (secure default)
✓ Only necessary HTTP methods are allowed
✓ Only necessary headers are allowed
✓ All CORS security checks passed!
```

## Migration Notes

### For Existing Deployments
1. Update `.env` file with new CORS settings
2. Restart the application to load new configuration
3. Verify Web UI still works (it should - same origin)
4. If external tools need access, add their origins specifically

### For New Deployments
- Use `.env.example` as template
- Default settings are secure and appropriate for single-origin deployment
- No changes needed unless external access required
